1. List each country name where the population is larger than that of 'Russia'.
* SELECT name FROM world WHERE population > 
	(SELECT population FROM world WHERE name LIKE 'Russia')

2. Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'.
* SELECT name FROM world WHERE continent LIKE 'Europe' AND gdp/population > 
	(SELECT gdp/population from world where name LIKE 'United Kingdom')

3. List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country.
* SELECT name, continent from world WHERE continent IN 
	(SELECT continent from world where name IN ('Argentina','Australia'))

4. Which country has a population that is more than United Kingdom but less than Germany? Show the name and the population.
* SELECT name, population FROM world WHERE population > 
	(SELECT population FROM world WHERE name LIKE 'United Kingdom') 
		AND population < 
			(SELECT population FROM world WHERE name LIKE 'Germany')

5. Germany (population 80 million) has the largest population of the countries in Europe. Austria (population 8.5 million) has 11% of the population of Germany.
Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.
* SELECT name, CONCAT(ROUND(100* population / (SELECT population from world where name='Germany')),%)
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'Europe'

6. Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)
* SELECT name FROM world WHERE gdp > 
	ALL(SELECT gdp from world WHERE continent LIKE 'Europe')

7. Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:
* SELECT continent, name, area FROM world c1
	WHERE area = (SELECT MAX(area) FROM world c2 WHERE c2.continent = c1.continent)

8. List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.
* SELECT continent, MIN(name) FROM world GROUP BY continent

9.Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.
* SELECT c1.name, c1.continent, c1.population FROM world c1 WHERE c1.continent IN
	(SELECT continent FROM world GROUP BY continent HAVING MAX(population) <= 25000000)
